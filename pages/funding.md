## Research Fellowship Competition for Temple University Graduate Students
CENFAD is now accepting applications from Temple graduate students for the John Votaw and Jeffrey Bower Fellowships (in the Fall) and the Marvin Wachman and Richard Immerman Fellowships (in the Spring).

All have been made available through the generous contributions of CENFAD supporters. Applicants for these funds must be Ph.D. students in the History Department. The application must include:

- A letter of application that spells out your qualifications for the award.
- A current C.V.
- A one-page description of your research project, if applicable. Include a statement of how you intend to use these funds, as precisely as possible.
