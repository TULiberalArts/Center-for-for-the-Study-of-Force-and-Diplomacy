## 2018 Research Fellowship Competition for Temple University Graduate Students
CENFAD is now accepting applications from Temple graduate students for the Marvin Wachman, John Votaw, and Jeffrey Bower Research Fellowships. These fellowships provide stipends of varying amounts to defray the cost of research conducted in connection with completion of the Ph.D. dissertation. All have been made available through the generous contributions of CENFAD supporters. Applicants for these funds must be advanced to Ph.D. candidacy or, if an M.A. student, expect to have completed the required coursework by the end of the Spring 2018 semester and have chosen the Thesis option. The application must include:

- A letter of application that spells out your qualifications for the award.
- A current C.V.
- A one-page description of your research project, if applicable. Include a statement of how you intend to use these funds, as precisely as possible. If plans include travel to archives or libraries, please indicate which ones, and provide an estimated budget for the research trip. Included budget descriptions can exceed the one page limit.
- One letter of recommendation.

Please attach the abstract, C.V., and statement, including expected date of graduation, as three separate files, and arrange for the advisor/reader to submit the letter of support separately (and also electronically).

A student is not eligible to receive the same award twice. However, receipt of one named CENFAD Research Fellowship does not preclude receiving another. Students do not apply for a specific award. They simply apply for a CENFAD research fellowship. Submissions must be made electronically to [Dr. Alan McPherson](mailto:alan.mcpherson@temple.edu).
