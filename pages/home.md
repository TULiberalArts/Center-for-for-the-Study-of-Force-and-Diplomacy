The Center for the Study of Force and Diplomacy (CENFAD) fosters interdisciplinary faculty and student research on the historic and contemporary use of force and diplomacy in a global context. The Center sponsors an ongoing lecture series and occasional workshops and colloquia. Each year, it also gives fellowships, prizes, and conference funding to recognize and support undergraduate and graduate research in military, diplomatic and international history.

The Director of CENFAD [Dr. Alan McPherson](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/mcpherson-alan), reports to the Dean of the College of Liberal Arts at Temple University. Housed within Temple University’s History Department, CENFAD was founded in 1993 by Drs. Richard Immerman, Russell Weigley, and David Rosenberg.
