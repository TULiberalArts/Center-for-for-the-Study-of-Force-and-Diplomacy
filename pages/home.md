The Center for the Study of Force and Diplomacy (CENFAD) fosters interdisciplinary faculty and student research on the historic and contemporary use of force and diplomacy in a global context. The Center sponsors an ongoing lecture series and occasional workshops and colloquia. Each year, it also gives fellowships, prizes, and conference funding to recognize and support undergraduate and graduate research in military, diplomatic and international history.

The Director of CENFAD [Dr. Alan McPherson](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/mcpherson-alan), reports to the Dean of the College of Liberal Arts at Temple University. Housed within Temple University’s History Department, CENFAD was founded in 1993 by Drs. Richard Immerman, Russell Weigley, and David Rosenberg.

#### Visiting Fellow! 
_**Erik Moore** is a postdoctoral associate at the University of Oklahoma’s Humanities Forum. He is also a 2018-2019 visiting fellow at Temple University’s Center for the Study of Force and Diplomacy. Moore was previously a Bullard-Wethington Fellow (2016-17) and a Hudson Family Fellow (2013-16) at the University of Oklahoma where he received his PhD in history in 2018. Before entering graduate school, Moore practiced law in the Kansas City area six years._

_Moore’s research focuses on law in U.S. foreign relations to explain how domestic conceptions of law interacted with that of other nations to influence international affairs. His current book project examines how U.S.-based NGOs, the Reagan administration, and the Nicaraguan government defined and then operationalized human rights as a transnational language of advocacy during the Contra War of the 1980s. Research in Sandinista records in Managua and in NGO archives throughout the United States demonstrates that Contra opponents tried to reframe the conflict for Congress and the American people as an issue of human rights, not Cold War geopolitics. Moore’s work will be published in the December 2018 issue of Diplomacy and Statecraft._
