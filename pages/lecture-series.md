## Events and Video
Over the years, CENFAD has invited guest speakers to give talks on issues that relate to the study of force and diplomacy. Past speakers have included Pulitzer- and Bancroft-winning scholars such as John Lewis Gaddis, Ari Kelman, Melvyn Leffler, and Fredrik Logevall, current and former government officials including Gov. Tom Ridge, Gen. Wesley Clark, Anthony Lake, and Aaron O’Connell, and scholars working on the cutting edge of military and diplomatic history like Stephen Biddle, Frank Costigliola, Greg Daddis, Brian DeLay, Thomas Fingar, Maria Höhn, Barbara Keys, Brian Linn, Jennifer Mittelstadt, Tim Naftali, Andrew Preston, Andrew Rotter, Dennis Showalter, and Mark Stoler. Many of these speakers have appeared under the auspices of the CENFAD colloquium series, which is an annual highlight at Temple. 

CENFAD normally schedules colloquia once or twice a month during the semester in the Russell F. Weigley Room, Gladfelter 914. **However, due to Covid-19 the speaker series will be held on Zoom for Fall 2020.** To suggest a speaker, contact CENFAD’s Thomas Davis Fellow, [Joshua Stern](mailto:tuj64084@temple.edu).

In this lecture, I will present and summarize the major findings of my 2019 book, _Challenging Beijing’s Mandate of Heaven_. I will use the perspective of social movement studies to make sense of the two student-led occupy movements in Taiwan and Hong Kong. In the latter part of my presentation, I will utilize this analytical framework to understand Hong Kong's anti-extradition protest that erupted in 2019 and conclude with an updated reflection about potential future courses.
