### Spring 2017
_"The Texas Gun Frontier and the Travails of Mexican History."_<br>
**Brian DeLay, University of California-Berkeley**<br>
**Wednesday, January 25, 2017 3:30pm**<br>

**Bio:** Brian DeLay teaches history at UC Berkeley. He is author of _War of a Thousand Deserts: Indian Raids and the U.S.-Mexican War_ (Yale University Press). He’s published articles on a variety of topics, including a comparison of instability in the 19th and 21st century borderlands;  Lincoln's policy toward the French Intervention; violence and belonging on the Navajo-New Mexican frontier; the international context for John Singleton Copley’s iconic painting Watson and the Shark; and Indians, U.S. Empire, and narratives of American foreign relations. He is the editor of _North American Borderlands_ (Routledge, 2012), and the coauthor of the U.S. history textbook _Experience History_. “Shoot the State,” his current book project for W.W. Norton, uses the arms trade to explore struggles over freedom and domination in the Americas from the age of revolutions through World War II.

**Abstract:** During the height of Mexico’s drug war-related violence a few years ago, Americans learned that an “Iron River of Guns” channeled arms and ammunition from U.S. dealers to Mexican cartels. What few in the U.S. realize is that the Iron River of Guns has a long and consequential backstory. This talk will explain the transformative role that U.S. arms exports played throughout the first century of Mexico’s independent history, from the war for independence from Spain in the 1810s through the Mexican Revolution in the 1910s.

_"Contested Practices, Women’s Rights, and Colonial Bodies in Pain: the UN’s Gender Politics in Africa, 1940s-1960s." _<br>
**Giusi Russo, Montgomery County Community College**<br>
**Wednesday, February 8, 2017 3:30pm**<br>

**Bio:** Giusi Russo is a historian of gender, empires, and internationalism. She received her PhD in History from the State University of New York at Binghamton in 2014. She is currently working on a book manuscript on the UN-led decolonization in Africa and the politics of the body. Her project explores how the UN imagined the post-colonial state from a gender and sexuality's point of view. An essay on her research experience at the UNESCO has been published in the UN History Project. Today's talk is part of her article currently invited to resubmit by the journal Gender & History. She will present her work on the United Nations at Oxford in March; she presented a version of today's paper at the SHAFR Conference and the Institute of Historical Research in London. She is currently full time History faculty at Montgomery County Community College where she teaches classes on Modern Europe and the History of Gender and Sexuality. 

**Abstract:** This paper discusses the collaborative work of the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women and the Trusteeship Council to define pain, rituals, and rights for African women in the transitional moment from colonialism to self-rule, (1948-1965). Polygamy and rituals that modify the female body, specifically, demonstrated the contradictions of the UN's politics of the body. The paper argues that the UN, under the form of its multiple actors involved in women’s rights in the colonies, claimed to advance women’s rights while simultaneously undermining them. The components of the UN world not always acted in agreement but they assumed different positions towards contested issues regarding the status of women. This work presents an original use of UN sources and draws on the main debates in the histories of gender and colonialism, and gender and diplomacy keeping in mind the recent paradigms of imperial histories.

_"Local People's Global Politics: The Hands Off Ethiopia Movement of 1935 as Transnational History."_<br>
**Joseph Fronczak, Princeton University**<br>
**Wednesday, February 22, 2017 3:30pm**<br>

**Bio:** Joseph Fronczak is a historian of the United States and the modern world, specializing in transnational and global history, the history of ideas, and the history of labor and capitalism. He was educated at the University of Wisconsin and he received his Ph.D. from Yale University, in 2014. The following year, he was a Mahindra Postdoctoral Fellow at Harvard University as part of the interdisciplinary Andrew H. Mellon Foundation Seminar on Violence and Non-violence. At Princeton, he has taught courses in global history and the history of U.S. foreign relations. He has also taught international history at Corpus Christi College, Oxford University. In the spring of 2016, he was a Visiting Fellow at the Hoover Institution of Stanford University. He is currently writing _Everything Is Possible: Antifascism and the Makings of a Global Left during the Great Depression_, which traces the political struggle between fascism and antifascism as it played out in the streets, factories, marketplaces, and plantations of the Depression-era world.

**Abstract:** During 1935, a transnational social movement coalesced to protest the Italian Fascist régime’s escalating threats to invade Ethiopia. Although the global antiwar movement failed to prevent war, it did, day by day through diffuse acts, transform the dynamics of global politics. Using a repertoire of informal political practices, including mass meetings, street fights, riots, and strikes, the movement enabled common people to directly assert themselves on a question of international affairs. This talk suggests a methodology for a rigorously transnational history capable of reshaping certain contours of international history.

_"Free Speech and Unfree News: The Paradox of Press Freedom in America."_<br>
**Sam Lebovic, George Mason University**<br>
**Wednesday, March 8, 2017 3:30pm**<br>

**Bio:** Sam Lebovic is Assistant Professor of History at George Mason University, and author of _Free Speech and Unfree News: The Paradox of Press Freedom in America_, which was published by Harvard University Press in March 2016.  He has published academic articles on the role of the media in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, on the history of the Fulbright program, on the Beatles and cultural globalization, and on the politics of popular culture during World War II.  He has also written historical articles for the _Boston Globe, the Columbia Journalism Review, and Politico Magazine_.

Sam's work on the history of press freedom was awarded the American Society for Legal History’s Paul Murphy Prize in the History of Civil Liberties in 2012, and was supported by fellowships from the Center for Cultural Analysis at Rutgers University, The Center for the Cold War and the U.S. at New York University, and the Truman Library Institute.  He is currently working on the intellectual and policy history of media globalization in the twentieth century, for which he was recently awarded a Nancy Weiss Malkiel Junior Faculty Fellowship by the Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation.  Lebovic currently serves as Associate Editor of the _Journal of Social History_.

**Abstract:** Does America have a free press? Many who answer yes appeal to First Amendment protections that shield the press from government censorship.  But Sam Lebovic’s history of modern press freedom shows that the right to free speech has been insufficient to guarantee a free press in an age of rising state secrecy and corporate newspaper consolidation.  The origins of our contemporary newspaper crises, he suggests, can be traced to failed twentieth-century efforts to guarantee a public right to the news.

_"Fighting With Faith: The Military Chaplaincy and the American State."_<br>
**Ronit Stahl, University of Pennsylvania**<br>
**Wednesday, April 5, 2017 3:30pm**<br>

**Bio:** Ronit Y. Stahl is a historian of American religion, law, and politics. She is currently a fellow in the Department of Medical Ethics at the University of Pennsylvania's Perelman School of Medicine. Previously, she was a postdoctoral research associate at the John C. Danforth Center on Religion and Politics at Washington University in St. Louis. She received her Ph.D. in history from the University of Michigan in 2014, and her writing has appeared in _The Huffington Post_, the _Immanent Frame_, and _Nursing Clio_. Her book, _Enlisting Faith: The Military Chaplaincy and the American State_ (Harvard University Press) will be published in 2017.

**Abstract:** The American state has long harnessed religion to great effect, and the military chaplaincy exemplifies how faith could fortify military aspirations and personnel. But what religious views did the military express and how did its religious commitments change over time? This talk examines how the military has used and managed religion over the twentieth century, demonstrating the complex processes and consequences of state investment in religion. It shows how, over time, active oversight of religion in the armed forces built a public (and publicly lauded) commitment to pluralism but also spurred a renewed interest in sectarianism.

_"Stalin’s Terror and Kennan’s Struggle for Reason."_<br>
**Frank Costigliola, University of Connecticut**<br>
**Thursday, May 4, 2017 3:30pm**<br>

**Bio:** Frank Costigliola is Board of Trustees Distinguished Professor at the University of Connecticut. He has received fellowships from the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, the Guggenheim Foundation, and the Norwegian Nobel Institute. His most recent books include _Roosevelt’s Lost Alliances: How Personal Politics Helped Start the Cold War_ (Princeton, 2012); _The Kennan Diaries_ (W.W. Norton, 2014); and [with Michael J. Hogan] _Explaining American Foreign Relations History_ (Cambridge, 2016). He is a former president of the Society for Historians of American Foreign Relations (SHAFR).

**Abstract:** George F. Kennan, America’s foremost strategist in the Cold War, harbored a love for the Russian people so strong that at times he felt that his “Russian self” was “more genuine” than his American identity. Working at the U.S. embassy in Moscow in the late 1930s, Kennan experienced Stalin’s purges of Soviet leaders as “hammer blows” to himself because so many of his Russian friends and acquaintances were arrested and executed. For his own mental balance and for his reporting to Washington, the young diplomat struggled to reach a coolly rational understanding of the terror. The irony is that while Kennan amidst such strain did achieve a nuanced, sophisticated analysis of the purges, Kennan in later years would succumb to an emotion-driven, simplistic view.

This lecture examines why Kennan felt the purges in such an intensely personal way and the nature of his struggle for reason. The talk will also consider the dilemma of trying to parse the elements of integrated cognitive thought and the question of how closely scholars can approach the thinking of historical figures.
