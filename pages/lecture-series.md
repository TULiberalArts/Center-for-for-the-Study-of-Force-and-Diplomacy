Past speakers have included Pulitzer- and Bancroft-winning scholars such as John Lewis Gaddis, Ari Kelman, Melvyn Leffler, and Fredrik Logevall, current and former government officials including Gov. Tom Ridge, Gen. Wesley Clark, Anthony Lake, and Aaron O’Connell, and scholars working on the cutting edge of military and diplomatic history like Stephen Biddle, Frank Costigliola, Greg Daddis, Brian DeLay, Thomas Fingar, Maria Höhn, Barbara Keys, Brian Linn, Jennifer Mittelstadt, Tim Naftali, Andrew Preston, Andrew Rotter, Dennis Showalter, and Mark Stoler.

### Spring 2017
_"The Texas Gun Frontier and the Travails of Mexican History."_<br>
**Brian DeLay, University of California-Berkeley**<br>
**Wednesday, January 25, 2017 3:30pm**<br>

**Bio:** Brian DeLay teaches history at UC Berkeley. He is author of _War of a Thousand Deserts: Indian Raids and the U.S.-Mexican War_ (Yale University Press). He’s published articles on a variety of topics, including a comparison of instability in the 19th and 21st century borderlands;  Lincoln's policy toward the French Intervention; violence and belonging on the Navajo-New Mexican frontier; the international context for John Singleton Copley’s iconic painting Watson and the Shark; and Indians, U.S. Empire, and narratives of American foreign relations. He is the editor of _North American Borderlands_ (Routledge, 2012), and the coauthor of the U.S. history textbook _Experience History_. “Shoot the State,” his current book project for W.W. Norton, uses the arms trade to explore struggles over freedom and domination in the Americas from the age of revolutions through World War II.

**Abstract:** During the height of Mexico’s drug war-related violence a few years ago, Americans learned that an “Iron River of Guns” channeled arms and ammunition from U.S. dealers to Mexican cartels. What few in the U.S. realize is that the Iron River of Guns has a long and consequential backstory. This talk will explain the transformative role that U.S. arms exports played throughout the first century of Mexico’s independent history, from the war for independence from Spain in the 1810s through the Mexican Revolution in the 1910s.

_"Contested Practices, Women’s Rights, and Colonial Bodies in Pain: the UN’s Gender Politics in Africa, 1940s-1960s." _<br>
**Giusi Russo, Montgomery County Community College**<br>
**Wednesday, February 8, 2017 3:30pm**<br>

**Bio:** Giusi Russo is a historian of gender, empires, and internationalism. She received her PhD in History from the State University of New York at Binghamton in 2014. She is currently working on a book manuscript on the UN-led decolonization in Africa and the politics of the body. Her project explores how the UN imagined the post-colonial state from a gender and sexuality's point of view. An essay on her research experience at the UNESCO has been published in the UN History Project. Today's talk is part of her article currently invited to resubmit by the journal Gender & History. She will present her work on the United Nations at Oxford in March; she presented a version of today's paper at the SHAFR Conference and the Institute of Historical Research in London. She is currently full time History faculty at Montgomery County Community College where she teaches classes on Modern Europe and the History of Gender and Sexuality. 

**Abstract:** This paper discusses the collaborative work of the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women and the Trusteeship Council to define pain, rituals, and rights for African women in the transitional moment from colonialism to self-rule, (1948-1965). Polygamy and rituals that modify the female body, specifically, demonstrated the contradictions of the UN's politics of the body. The paper argues that the UN, under the form of its multiple actors involved in women’s rights in the colonies, claimed to advance women’s rights while simultaneously undermining them. The components of the UN world not always acted in agreement but they assumed different positions towards contested issues regarding the status of women. This work presents an original use of UN sources and draws on the main debates in the histories of gender and colonialism, and gender and diplomacy keeping in mind the recent paradigms of imperial histories.

_"Local People's Global Politics: The Hands Off Ethiopia Movement of 1935 as Transnational History."_<br>
**Joseph Fronczak, Princeton University**<br>
**Wednesday, February 22, 2017 3:30pm**<br>

**Bio:** Joseph Fronczak is a historian of the United States and the modern world, specializing in transnational and global history, the history of ideas, and the history of labor and capitalism. He was educated at the University of Wisconsin and he received his Ph.D. from Yale University, in 2014. The following year, he was a Mahindra Postdoctoral Fellow at Harvard University as part of the interdisciplinary Andrew H. Mellon Foundation Seminar on Violence and Non-violence. At Princeton, he has taught courses in global history and the history of U.S. foreign relations. He has also taught international history at Corpus Christi College, Oxford University. In the spring of 2016, he was a Visiting Fellow at the Hoover Institution of Stanford University. He is currently writing _Everything Is Possible: Antifascism and the Makings of a Global Left during the Great Depression_, which traces the political struggle between fascism and antifascism as it played out in the streets, factories, marketplaces, and plantations of the Depression-era world.

**Abstract:** During 1935, a transnational social movement coalesced to protest the Italian Fascist régime’s escalating threats to invade Ethiopia. Although the global antiwar movement failed to prevent war, it did, day by day through diffuse acts, transform the dynamics of global politics. Using a repertoire of informal political practices, including mass meetings, street fights, riots, and strikes, the movement enabled common people to directly assert themselves on a question of international affairs. This talk suggests a methodology for a rigorously transnational history capable of reshaping certain contours of international history.

_"Free Speech and Unfree News: The Paradox of Press Freedom in America."_<br>
**Sam Lebovic, George Mason University**<br>
**Wednesday, March 8, 2017 3:30pm**<br>

**Bio:** Sam Lebovic is Assistant Professor of History at George Mason University, and author of _Free Speech and Unfree News: The Paradox of Press Freedom in America_, which was published by Harvard University Press in March 2016.  He has published academic articles on the role of the media in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, on the history of the Fulbright program, on the Beatles and cultural globalization, and on the politics of popular culture during World War II.  He has also written historical articles for the _Boston Globe, the Columbia Journalism Review, and Politico Magazine_.

Sam's work on the history of press freedom was awarded the American Society for Legal History’s Paul Murphy Prize in the History of Civil Liberties in 2012, and was supported by fellowships from the Center for Cultural Analysis at Rutgers University, The Center for the Cold War and the U.S. at New York University, and the Truman Library Institute.  He is currently working on the intellectual and policy history of media globalization in the twentieth century, for which he was recently awarded a Nancy Weiss Malkiel Junior Faculty Fellowship by the Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation.  Lebovic currently serves as Associate Editor of the _Journal of Social History_.

**Abstract:** Does America have a free press? Many who answer yes appeal to First Amendment protections that shield the press from government censorship.  But Sam Lebovic’s history of modern press freedom shows that the right to free speech has been insufficient to guarantee a free press in an age of rising state secrecy and corporate newspaper consolidation.  The origins of our contemporary newspaper crises, he suggests, can be traced to failed twentieth-century efforts to guarantee a public right to the news.

_"Fighting With Faith: The Military Chaplaincy and the American State."_<br>
**Ronit Stahl, University of Pennsylvania**<br>
**Wednesday, April 5, 2017 3:30pm**<br>

**Bio:** Ronit Y. Stahl is a historian of American religion, law, and politics. She is currently a fellow in the Department of Medical Ethics at the University of Pennsylvania's Perelman School of Medicine. Previously, she was a postdoctoral research associate at the John C. Danforth Center on Religion and Politics at Washington University in St. Louis.

Her book, _Enlisting Faith: The Military Chaplaincy and the American State_ (Harvard University Press) will be published in 2017.

**Abstract:** The American state has long harnessed religion to great effect, and the military chaplaincy exemplifies how faith could fortify military aspirations and personnel. But what religious views did the military express and how did its religious commitments change over time? This talk examines how the military has used and managed religion over the twentieth century, demonstrating the complex processes and consequences of state investment in religion. It shows how, over time, active oversight of religion in the armed forces built a public (and publicly lauded) commitment to pluralism but also spurred a renewed interest in sectarianism.

_"Stalin’s Terror and Kennan’s Struggle for Reason."_<br>
**Frank Costigliola, University of Connecticut**<br>
**Thursday, May 4, 2017 3:30pm**<br>

**Bio:** Frank Costigliola is Board of Trustees Distinguished Professor at the University of Connecticut. He has received fellowships from the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, the Guggenheim Foundation, and the Norwegian Nobel Institute. His most recent books include _Roosevelt’s Lost Alliances: How Personal Politics Helped Start the Cold War_ (Princeton, 2012); _The Kennan Diaries_ (W.W. Norton, 2014); and [with Michael J. Hogan] _Explaining American Foreign Relations History_ (Cambridge, 2016). He is a former president of the Society for Historians of American Foreign Relations (SHAFR).

**Abstract:** George F. Kennan, America’s foremost strategist in the Cold War, harbored a love for the Russian people so strong that at times he felt that his “Russian self” was “more genuine” than his American identity. Working at the U.S. embassy in Moscow in the late 1930s, Kennan experienced Stalin’s purges of Soviet leaders as “hammer blows” to himself because so many of his Russian friends and acquaintances were arrested and executed. For his own mental balance and for his reporting to Washington, the young diplomat struggled to reach a coolly rational understanding of the terror. The irony is that while Kennan amidst such strain did achieve a nuanced, sophisticated analysis of the purges, Kennan in later years would succumb to an emotion-driven, simplistic view.

This lecture examines why Kennan felt the purges in such an intensely personal way and the nature of his struggle for reason. The talk will also consider the dilemma of trying to parse the elements of integrated cognitive thought and the question of how closely scholars can approach the thinking of historical figures.

_"'We’re Not Mercenaries':American Conservatives and Paramilitary Violence in the Late Cold War."_<br>
**Kyle Burke, Temple University**<br>
**Wedenesday, October 5, 2016 3:30pm**<br>

**Bio:** Kyle Burke is a historian of US politics, culture, and foreign relations who specializes in the Cold War. He received his PhD in history from Northwestern University in 2015. Before coming to Temple, he held fellowships at New York University's Center for the United States and the Cold War, the Society for Historians of American Foreign Relations, and the Buffet Institute for Global Studies.  He is currently completing a book entitled _Revolutionaries for the Right: American Conservatives, Anticommunist Internationalism, and Covert Warfare in the Cold War_ (UNC Press, forthcoming), which examines the rise and fall of an international network of right-wing paramilitaries from the 1950s through the 1980s.

**Abstract:** In the late Cold War, right-leaning Americans launched a series of private paramilitary schemes in Latin America, Asia, and Africa. By doing so, they hoped to realize the global ambitions of the Reagan Doctrine, a global anticommunist offensive to be carried out by guerrilla movements in nearly a dozen countries. However, as Congress, the American public, and a transnational human rights movement offered stiff resistance to the Reagan administration’s covert wars, many on the right concluded that the private sector was better suited to channel money, weapons, supplies, and advisers to embattled anticommunist guerrillas. And so, using millions of dollars in donations from wealthy individuals and businesses, international organizations, and grassroots conservative groups, they purchased weapons and supplies and sponsored training programs, propaganda campaigns, and recruitment drives. Their efforts tapped into a strain of revanchist masculinity, and helped catalyze and legitimize a growing paramilitary subculture at home which, in turn, supplied hundreds of American mercenaries for conflicts in overseas.

_"Negotiating Borderlines in the Eighteenth-Century: Habsburg Cartography and Diplomacy during the Reigns of Maria Theresa and Joseph II."_<br>
**Madalina Veres, Temple University**<br>
**Monday, October 24, 2016 3:30pm**<br>

**Bio:** Madalina Veres is an historian of the Habsburg Monarchy in a global context and is interested in the history of science in the early-modern period with a focus on cartography. She is currently working on her book manuscript entitled “Foot Soldiers of Empire. Habsburg Cartographers in the Age of Enlightened Reform” based on her PhD dissertation defended at the University of Pittsburgh in 2015. Madalina’s work has appeared in journals, such as the _Austrian History Yearbook_ and _Itinerario, International Journal on the History of European Expansion and Global Interaction_, and in collective volumes dedicated to the history of cartography.

**Abstract:** Examining the historical creation of international borders reveals that in the eighteenth century Eurasian polities signed treaties that implemented linear, clearly demarcated borderlines, enforced by state agents. This new desire to regulate the situation of frontiers partially emerged as a result of changes in the technology of mapmaking. At the time, cartography became an ally of enlightened governments and military engineers surveyed territories and their borders. In this talk I explore how, from 1750 until 1790, Habsburg rulers Maria Theresa (r. 1740-1780) and Joseph II (r. 1765-1790) pursued a consistent policy of signing border treaties with their neighbors. I discuss for the cases of Austrian Netherlands, Lombardy and Transylvania, how in the eighteenth century, maps transformed from mere optional appendixes to international treaties into a key documentary base used in the negotiation and the border demarcation process. I argue that cartographic products of the second half of the eighteenth century were not only mirroring political developments but were even conditioning diplomatic negotiations regarding the trajectory of state borders.

_"Trade Deals: Why Politicians Love To Hate Them."_<br>
**Amitendu Palit, National University of Singapore**<br>
**Monday, October 31, 2016 3:30pm**<br>
**Co-Sponsored by the Center for the Humanities at Temple**<br>

**Bio:** Dr Amitendu Palit is Senior Research Fellow and Research Lead (Trade and Economic Policy) at the Institute of South Asian Studies (ISAS) in the National University of Singapore (NUS). He is an economist specializing in international trade policies, regional economic developments, comparative economic studies and political economy of public policies. He worked with the Government of India for several years with his longest span being in the Department of Economic Affairs in the Ministry of Finance, India. Prior to joining ISAS in April 2008, he was with the Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations (ICRIER), a leading economic policy research institute and think-tank in Delhi. His current research focuses on economic and political implications of India’s integration with the Asia-Pacific region, impact of mega-regional trade agreements, and various determinants of external trade and integration policies of China and India. His books include _The Trans Pacific Partnership, China and India: Economic and Political Implications_ (2014; Routledge UK), _China India Economics: Challenges, Competition and Collaboration_ (2011; Routledge) and _Special Economic Zones in India: Myths and Realities_ (2008; Anthem Press; Co-authored). He has also edited several books and published in peer-reviewed academic journals. He is a columnist for India’s well known financial daily, Financial Express and a regular contributor for the China Daily. He appears regularly as an expert on the BBC, Bloomberg, Channel News Asia, CNBC, Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), Doordarshan (India) and All-India Radio.

**Abstract:** Trade agreements have been the favourite whipping boys in elections taking place across the world. Be it in the US, Europe or Asia, politicians have attacked trade deals, particularly humongous agreements like the TPP and TTIP, for their adverse impacts on livelihoods, jobs and access to medicines. Ironically, political establishments themselves have been among the biggest backers of trade deals otherwise, not only on economic grounds, but also geo-strategic factors. The TPP exemplifies these contrasts as a trade deal being torn to shreds during the US Presidential elections across the political spectrum; as a deal vociferously championed by the Obama Administration for supporting higher-paying American jobs; and finally as a deal that enables the US, not ‘other countries’ write the rules of trade and contribute positively to the US national security agenda. Why do cross-country trade deals, and national trade policies, evoke such contrasting postures among political actors in different situations? The talk will examine the question at a time when mega-regional trade agreements desperately search greater political legitimacy and popular acceptance.

_"Our Latest Longest War: Afghanistan, American Exceptionalism, and the Future of Military History."_<br>
**Aaron O'Connell, National Security Council**<br>
**Friday, November 11, 2016 1:00pm**<br>
**Co-Sponsored by the College of Liberal Arts**<br>

**Bio:** Dr. Aaron B. O’Connell is a historian, a musician, an author and a Marine.  He holds a PhD in history and a master’s degree in American Studies from Yale University as well as a master’s degree in American literature from Indiana University. As a Marine reservist, he has served as a strategic analyst for the Commandant of the Marine Corps, a Special Assistant to General David H. Petraeus in Afghanistan, a Special Advisor to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and as the Senior Defense Official and Defense Attache' to the U.S. Embassy in South Sudan.   He is the author of _Underdogs: The Making of the Modern Marine Corps_ (Harvard University Press, 2012), and the lead author and editor of _Our Latest Longest War:  Losing Hearts and Minds in Afghanistan_ (Chicago University Press, 2017).  His writings on military culture have also appeared in the _New York Times, the Chronicle of Higher Education, The Daily Beast_, and numerous other journals and publications. From 2008-2016 he was associate professor of history at the US Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, and he now serves as the Director of Defense Policy and Strategy on the National Security Council.  

**Abstract:** Dr. O'Connell will discuss his forthcoming collection of essays, _Our Latest Longest War: Losing Hearts and Minds in Afghanistan_. In it, he argues that the single most important factor affecting the Afghanistan War was pervasive cultural friction:  incompatible assumptions and habits of mind both within the NATO coalition and between the westerners and the Afghans.  Problems of culture derailed nearly every field of endeavor in the war:  decision-making in Washington, conventional operations, training the Afghan army and police, reconstruction and development work, rule-of-law development, and Special Forces operations. Because of the ideas Americans took to war with them, the results were goals unmoored from reality, massive over-spending, thousands of lives lost, and very little else.  Dr. O’Connell’s talk will also draw troubling parallels to the Vietnam War to argue that deep-running currents in American culture explain why the U.S. has repeatedly used armed nation-building to try to transform failing states into modern, liberal democracies. He will conclude with a critique of the field of military history and offer directions for future research.

_"'A Cursed Country to Make War in:' The German Auxiliary Troops in the War for American Independence."_<br>
**Friederike Baer, Penn State Abington**<br>
**Wednesday, November 16, 2016 3:30pm**<br>

**Bio:** Friederike Baer is Associate Professor of History at Penn State Abington College. Her research focuses on the experiences of German-speaking people in late eighteenth and nineteenth century North America. She is the author of _The Trial of Frederick Eberle: Language, Patriotism and Citizenship in Philadelphia’s German Community_, 1790-1830 (NYU Press, 2008). Her other publications include essays in _Early American Studies, The Journal of the Civil War Era_, and the _Journal for Eighteenth-Century Studies_. She is currently completing a book on the German auxiliary troops in the War for American Independence.

**Abstract:** In the 1770s and 1780s, Britain employed at least 30,000 German soldiers in its quest to put down the American rebellion. The rulers of several German territories within the Holy Roman Empire hired out these troops in exchange for subsidy payments. By 1781, more than one third of the British army’s strength in North America consisted of soldiers that soon became known as the “Hessians,” regardless of place of origin. These troops, which were accompanied by hundreds of civilians, including women and children, produced a wealth of private and public records that offer unique perspectives on American society during the revolutionary period. An examination of these German-authored accounts sheds light on often neglected aspects of the war, ranging from the theater of war in the Gulf Coast region to the decision of at least one hundred African Americans to return with German regiments to Europe in 1783.

_"Foreign Intervention in Africa: From The Cold War to the War on Terror."_<br>
**Elizabeth Schmidt, Loyola University Maryland**<br>
**Wednesday, December 7, 2016 3:30pm**<br>

**Bio:** Elizabeth Schmidt is professor of history at Loyola University Maryland.  She received her Ph.D. from the University of Wisconsin-Madison.  Her books include: _Foreign Intervention in Africa: From the Cold War to the War on Terror_ (2013); _Cold War and Decolonization in Guinea, 1946-1958_ (2007); _Mobilizing the Masses: Gender, Ethnicity, and Class in the Nationalist Movement in Guinea, 1939-1958_ (2005); _Peasants, Traders, and Wives: Shona Women in the History of Zimbabwe, 1870-1939_ (1992); and _Decoding Corporate Camouflage: U.S. Business Support for Apartheid_ (1980).  Her next book, _Foreign Intervention in Africa after the Cold War: Sovereignty, Responsibility, and the War on Terror_, will be published by Ohio University Press.

**Abstract:** Colonialism in Africa collapsed after World War II, opening the door to political and military intervention by Cold War powers that competed with the former imperial powers to control the decolonization process.  African nationalists courted, accommodated, and opposed external powers and limited their ability to impose solutions.  However, external support for African regimes that served outside interests led to decades of corruption and misrule that laid the foundations for many post-Cold War conflicts, which in turn attracted new waves of foreign intervention.  After the Cold War, the rationale for political and military intervention was no longer the “communist threat” or African liberation, but rather the “responsibility to protect” or the “war on terror.”  During both periods, humanitarian justifications frequently masked parochial interests, external remedies often failed to address underlying grievances, and African civil society was generally excluded from negotiations for a new order.  As a result, foreign political and military intervention often harmed the people they were officially intended to help.

_"Self-Determination, Economic Sovereignty and International History."_<br>
**Bradley Simpson, University of Connecticut**<br>
**Wednesday, January 20, 2016 3:30pm**<br>

**Bio:** Brad Simpson is associate professor of history and Asian Studies at the University of Connecticut. He is the author of _Economists with Guns: Authoritarian Development and U.S.-Indonesian Relations, 1960-1968_(Stanford 2008). During his time at the Humanities Institute Brad is writing a global history of the idea of self-determination, exploring its political, cultural and legal descent through post-1945 U.S. foreign relations and international politics, to be published by Oxford University Press.

**Abstract:** Self-determination is one of the most important – and contested – ideas in modern international politics. Yet scholars largely take its meaning and history for granted. This talk will explore the emergence and dispersal of claims to the ‘right of economic self-determination’ after 1941, claims which were bitterly opposed by the great powers, and the ways in which its proponents sought to enlarge the scope of sovereignty and rights during the Cold War.

_"The Rise of the Military Welfare State."_<br>
**Jennifer Mittelstadt, Rutgers University**<br>
**Tuesday, February 23, 2016 3:30pm**<br>

**Bio:** Jennifer Mittelstadt is Associate Professor of History at Rutgers University, New Brunswick.  She has written and edited two books on social welfare, _From Welfare to Workfare:  The Unintended Consequences of Liberal Reform, 1945-1965_ (Chapel Hill:  University of North Carolina Press, 2005) and (with Premilla Nadasen and Marisa Chappell) _Welfare in the United States: A History with Documents_ (New York:  Routledge, 2009).  A former fellow at the Woodrow Wilson Center for International Scholars, her writing has appeared in such publications as _Jacobin, the New York Times_, and the _LA Times_.  Her most recent book is _The Rise of the Military Welfare State_ (Harvard, 2015).

**Abstract:** Since the end of the draft, the U.S. Army has prided itself on its patriotic volunteers who heed the call to “Be All That You Can Be.” But beneath the recruitment slogans, the army promised volunteers something more tangible: a social safety net including medical and dental care, education, child care, financial counseling, housing assistance, legal services, and other privileges that had long been reserved for career soldiers. _The Rise of the Military Welfare State_ examines how the U.S. Army’s extension of benefits to enlisted men and women created a military welfare system of unprecedented size and scope.

America’s all-volunteer army took shape in the 1970s, in the wake of widespread opposition to the draft. Abandoning compulsory conscription, it wrestled with how to attract and retain soldiers—a task made more difficult by the military’s plummeting prestige after Vietnam. The army solved the problem, Mittelstadt shows, by promising to take care of its own—the more than ten million Americans who volunteered for active duty after 1973 and their families. While the United States dismantled its civilian welfare system in the 1980s and 1990s, army benefits continued to expand.

Yet not everyone was pleased by programs that, in their view, encouraged dependency, infantilized soldiers, and feminized the institution. Fighting to outsource and privatize the army’s “socialist” system and to reinforce “self-reliance” among American soldiers, opponents rolled back some of the military welfare state’s signature achievements, even as a new era of war began.

_"Arsenal of Liberty: The Development of American Military Manufacturing in the Early Republic."_<br>
**Andrew J.B. Fagal, Princeton University, Assistant Editor, The Papers of Thomas Jefferson**<br>
**Wednesday, March 16, 2016 3:30pm**<br>

**Bio:** Andrew J. B. Fagal is an assistant editor for the Papers of Thomas Jefferson at Princeton University. He received his Ph.D. from Binghamton University, the State University of New York, in 2013 and has had his work on the War of 1812 published in _The New England Quarterly_ and _New York History_. He is currently completing his book manuscript on the political economy of war in the early republic.

**Abstract:** Between the American Revolution and the War of 1812 there was a fundamental transformation in American manufacturing capacity. During the War of Independence the Continental Congress and state governments were forced to turn to the international market for arms and munitions as domestic suppliers could not hope to meet the army's material demands. The situation some thirty years later was vastly different as domestic suppliers such as DuPont, Eli Whitney, and the Springfield Armory were able to keep the armed forces well-supplied with the instruments of battle. This talk will explore why this broad economic change occurred, the domestic politics and policies behind it, and its significance for understanding the nature of governance in the early American republic.
