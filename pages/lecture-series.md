_“Activists and Insurgents: Human Rights Advocacy During the Contra War, 1981-1988”_<br>
**Erik Moore, CENFAD Non-Resident Fellow and Postdoctorial Associate at the University of Oklahoma**<br>
**Wednesday, February 6, 2019 4:30 pm**<br>
**Bio:** Erik Moore is a postdoctoral associate at the University of Oklahoma’s Humanities Forum. He is also a 2018-2019 visiting fellow at Temple University’s Center for the Study of Force and Diplomacy. Moore was previously a Bullard-Wethington Fellow (2016-17) and a Hudson Family Fellow (2013-16) at the University of Oklahoma where he received his PhD in history in 2018. Before entering graduate school, Moore practiced law in the Kansas City area six years.

Moore’s research focuses on law in U.S. foreign relations to explain how domestic conceptions of law interacted with that of other nations to influence international affairs. His current book project examines how U.S.-based NGOs, the Reagan administration, and the Nicaraguan government defined and then operationalized human rights as a transnational language of advocacy during the Contra War of the 1980s. Research in Sandinista records in Managua and in NGO archives throughout the United States demonstrates that Contra opponents tried to reframe the conflict for Congress and the American people as an issue of human rights, not Cold War geopolitics. Moore’s work will be published in the December 2018 issue of _Diplomacy and Statecraft_.
