## Events and Video
Over the years, CENFAD has invited guest speakers to give talks on issues that relate to the study of force and diplomacy. Past speakers have included Pulitzer- and Bancroft-winning scholars such as John Lewis Gaddis, Ari Kelman, Melvyn Leffler, and Fredrik Logevall, current and former government officials including Gov. Tom Ridge, Gen. Wesley Clark, Anthony Lake, and Aaron O’Connell, and scholars working on the cutting edge of military and diplomatic history like Stephen Biddle, Frank Costigliola, Greg Daddis, Brian DeLay, Thomas Fingar, Maria Höhn, Barbara Keys, Brian Linn, Jennifer Mittelstadt, Tim Naftali, Andrew Preston, Andrew Rotter, Dennis Showalter, and Mark Stoler. Many of these speakers have appeared under the auspices of the CENFAD colloquium series, which is an annual highlight at Temple. 

CENFAD normally schedules colloquia once or twice a month during the semester in the Russell F. Weigley Room, Gladfelter 914. **However, due to Covid-19 the speaker series will be held on Zoom for Fall 2020.** To suggest a speaker, contact CENFAD’s Thomas Davis Fellow, [Joshua Stern](mailto:tuj64084@temple.edu).

_“In Camps: Vietnamese Refugees, Asylum Seekers, and Repatriates”_<br>
**Dr. Jana K. Lipman, Associate Professor of History at Tulane University**<br>
**Wednesday, September 30, 4:30pm**<br>

Dr. Lipman is a scholar of U.S. foreign relations, U.S. immigration, and labor history. While her research spans numerous geographies, from Cuba to Hong Kong, at its core it investigates the local histories of diplomatic politics. Her first monograph, _Guantánamo: A Working-Class History between Empire and Revolution_ (University of California Press, 2009), argued how Cuban base workers were key actors in shaping U.S.-Cuban relations in Guantánamo, before, during, and after the revolution. 

Her new book, _In Camps: Vietnamese Refugees, Asylum-Seekers, and Repatriates_ (University of California Press, 2020), reveals how first asylum sites (places that hosted refugee camps) “pushed” the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to reshape international refugee policy. It also argues how Vietnamese activists in the camps and diasporic activists in resettlement countries influenced U.S. and international refugee policy. This project engages with questions raised by historians of human rights, humanitarianism, refugee studies, and Asian American studies. _In Camps_ raises key questions that remain all too relevant today: Who is a refugee? Who determines this status? And how does it change over time? Drawn from archival research in Malaysia, Hong Kong, the Philippines, the UNHCR, and southern California, _In Camps_ pays close attention to host territories and Vietnamese activism in the camps and the diaspora.

Dr. Lipman has also published essays about the relationship between the U.S. military and refugee camps, and she co-edited multiple projects on U.S. Empire.  Her future projects include investigating the histories of sexual violence and the U.S. military, collaborative projects on Southeast Asia and U.S. foreign relations, and an ongoing commitment to public history.

_How to Hide an Empire: Telling the Story of the Greater United States”_<br>
**Dr. Daniel Immerwahr, Professor at Northwestern University**<br>
**Wednesday, November 18, 4:30pm**<br>

Look at a map of the United States and you'll see the familiar cluster of states in North America, plus Hawai'i and Alaska in boxes. But what about Puerto Rico? What about American Samoa? The country has held overseas territory--lands containing millions of U.S. nationals--for the bulk of its history. They don't appear often in textbooks, but the outposts and colonies of the United States have been central to its history. This talk explores what U.S. history would look like if it weren't just the history of the continental states but of all U.S. land: the Greater United States.

Dr. Daniel Immerwahr, is a professor of history at Northwestern University, where he teaches global history and U.S. foreign relations. His first book, _Thinking Small_ (Harvard 2015), a history of U.S. grassroots antipoverty strategies, won the Organization of American Historians' Merle Curti Award for best work of U.S. intellectual history. His second, _How to Hide an Empire_ (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2019), a retelling of U.S. history with the overseas parts of the country included in the story, is a national bestseller. Immerwahr is currently working on two research projects, one on the pop culture of U.S. global hegemony, the other a book about nineteenth-century urban catastrophes. Immerwahr's writings have appeared in the _New York Times, Washington Post, The Guardian, Slate, The Nation_, and _The New Republic_.

Dr. Immerwahr’s writing has appeared in the _New York Times, The New Republic, The Guardian, The Nation, Slate, Diplomatic History, Modern Intellectual History, the Journal of the History of Ideas, the Journal of African Cultural Studies, Modern American History, Jacobin, n+1 and Dissent_, among other venues.
