The International History Workshop seeks to promote the exchange of ideas among scholars working on international, transnational, and global history; and to develop contacts between Temple faculty and graduate students working in this area and their peers at other leading programs in the country.

“International history” is short-hand for scholarship that explores the history of international relations in the broadest sense. In our era of globalization, historians have grown ever more aware of the need for historical scholarship that draws on various methodologies and that examines inter-connections between states, peoples, and regional or global processes. Some international historians focus chiefly on state-to-state relations and warfare, and use sources generated by states, armies, and government agencies. This approach to international history has been much enriched by new work on topics such as empires and their collapse, borderlands, comparative genocide, ideological conflict, ethnicities, gender, migration, non-governmental organizations, health and disease, environment and scarcity issues, and so on.

Temple’s History Department is unusually rich in faculty that work on international history. We have scholars here who are experts not only on one nation, continent, or time period, but on historical trends and patterns that cross borders and that find peoples of various national backgrounds interacting, competing, warring and even peace-making. This is why we have attracted such an able body of graduate students here to work in these areas, and they are beginning to make their mark in the field of international history.
